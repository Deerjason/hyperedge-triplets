    "## Maximum Hyperedge Triplets\n",

    "In hypergraphs, hyperedge triplets are sequence-independent sets of three unique hyperedges. Hyperedge triplets vary in their connectivity patterns. In the following figure, we show the venn diagram of three hyperedges where each region represents the intersection between its corresponding hyperedges. We denote the three green regions as the *independent* regions, the three blue regions as the *disjoint* regions, and the red region as the *common* region.\n",
